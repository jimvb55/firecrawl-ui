# Development Progress

## Security Improvements

### Environment Variables
- [x] Removed sensitive API keys from backend/.env
- [x] Consolidated environment variables to root .env file
- [x] Created .env.example as a template
- [x] Updated .gitignore to exclude all .env files
- [x] Updated docker-compose.dev.yml to use root .env for all services

### Documentation
- [x] Created comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
- [x] Added security notes and best practices
- [x] Documented project structure and deployment process

## Next Steps

### Security
- [ ] Implement API key rotation mechanism
- [ ] Add rate limiting per API key
- [ ] Add request logging and monitoring
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for API key issues

### Development
- [ ] Add automated tests
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add code linting and formatting
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries in React components

### Docker
- [ ] Optimize Docker builds
- [ ] Add production Docker configuration
- [ ] Implement proper health checks
- [ ] Add container security scanning

## Known Issues
1. Need to ensure all API calls go through backend proxy
2. Should implement proper error handling for API key validation
3. Consider adding request logging for security monitoring

## Windows Development Notes
- Ensure line endings are consistently LF
- Docker volume mounts may need adjustment on Windows
- Consider adding cross-platform scripts in package.json
